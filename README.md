### Running with options
Running `python connect4.py -h` gives the following output:

```
Usage: connect4.py [options]
                            
Options:                    
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --ascii           This changes the game piece into a blocky ascii
                        character. Use this option if the game piece is an
                        invalid character.
  --hc, --high-contrast
                        This changes the yellow player colour into more
                        visible colour (cyan). Use this option if the game
                        pieces are difficult to see
```
